Visual design is a crucial element in various forms of scientific communication, ranging from papers, slides, to even videos. Nice figures serve as an effective tool in conveying complex ideas and information and makes them easily digestible and engaging; carefully designed tables can break down complex results and help people compare, contrast, and draw conclusions. While there is an increasing need for researchers to produce high-quality visuals, it remains to be a time-consuming and sometimes very challenging task. Despite the significant role they play, there is a noticeable lack of formal education dedicated to this aspect: imagine as if you were required to write a formal article without ever having been properly taught the principles of grammar.

This subject aims to cover several key topics about visual designs in scholarly communication. Throughout this subject, you will learn: 
1. basics and principles for visual design in scholarly communication 
2. techniques for creating high-quality figures/tables/visualizations

### Administrative details

This class is taught by [Shannon Shen](https://www.szj.io/) and [Lucas Torroba Hennigen](https://ltorroba.github.io/). We also feature a guest lecture by [Prof. Andrew Head](https://www.andrewhead.info/) from UPenn. Please reach out to us if you have any questions or need any special accommodations!
You can do so by joining the class Slack by clicking [here](https://join.slack.com/t/better-visual/shared_invite/zt-2a2bjoizb-hiTF6jP6i0WqS69jqc~AJQ), or by [e-mailing us](mailto:zjshen@mit.edu,lucastor@mit.edu) directly.

We will do our best to record all the lectures and put them up online shortly after the class, alongside slides and some notes.

### Schedule
_The class will take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays from **1-2:30pm in 26-204**. All the sessions will be recorded and posted on the website. The schedule is subject to change. Please check back regularly for updates._


| <span class="text-grey-dk-000" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Jan 9</span><br>**Fundamentals**     | <span class="label label-green" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lecture</span> <br> This unit will cover fundamental topics in visual design. We will go through key visual abstractions like colors, shapes, arrangements described in the book Visualization analysis and design by Munzner. It will form a solid foundation to other topics in the class. |
| <span class="text-grey-dk-000" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Jan 11</span><br>**Figures** | <span class="label label-green" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lecture</span> <span class="label label-blue" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lab</span> <br>  It starts with case studies on nice figures in recent scientific papers, illustrating key components of a good figure. Then we explain how to use the tool Figma to create these figures, explaining the techniques and workflow for creating figures. | 
| <span class="text-grey-dk-000" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Jan 16</span><br>**Math & Equations** | <span class="label label-red" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Guest Lecture</span> <span class="label label-blue" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lab</span> <br> [Prof. Andrew Head](https://andrewhead.info/) from UPenn will give a talk about improving the presentation of math formulas to make them more approachable. This talk will cover some of his latest research in this direction including [Math Augmentation](https://andrewhead.info/assets/pdf/augmented-formulas.pdf) and [FFL: A Language and Live Runtime for Styling and Labeling Typeset Math Formulas](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3586183.3606731). | 
| <span class="text-grey-dk-000" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Jan 18</span><br>**Tables & Plots** | <span class="label label-green" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lecture</span> <span class="label label-blue" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lab</span> <br> This unit focuses on how to present complex quantitative experiment results in either tables and plots. It covers the principles of table design, as well as techniques on how to use latex to build complex tables. In the 2nd half we will look through some plots and recent computer science papers, discuss their design, and reproduce these plots using primarily Python and Matplotlib. This can be a primer to courses like 6.859 Interactive Data Visualization that is going to be taught in the subsequent spring semester. | 
| <span class="text-grey-dk-000" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Jan 23</span><br>**Slides & Animation** | <span class="label label-green" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lecture</span> <span class="label label-blue" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lab</span> <br> This unit addresses how to translate results in papers to a slide/presentation format. Specifically, it covers the principles of making slides for talk, as well as techniques for presenting complex results. Animations will be a key component in the design of the slides, and we will cover techniques for making proper animations. Optionally we can cover some techniques for recording talk videos (which is often required for accepted papers). |
| <span class="text-grey-dk-000" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Jan 25</span><br>**Potpourri** | <span class="label label-green" style="margin: 0 2px 4px 0;">Lecture</span> <br> This lecture will cover some other miscellaneous aspects of visual design like typesetting techniques and how LLM/GenAI can be helpful in creating visualizations. |
