### TL;DR

Visual design is a crucial element in various forms of scientific communication, ranging from papers, slides, to even videos. While there is an increasing need for researchers to produce high-quality visuals, it remains to be a time-consuming and sometimes very challenging task. Despite the significant role they play, there is a noticeable lack of formal education dedicated to this aspect. This subject aims to cover several key topics about visual designs in scholarly communication. Throughout this subject, you will learn: 
1. basics and principles for visual design in scholarly communication 
2. techniques for creating high-quality figures/tables/visualizations

### Instructors

This class is taught by [Shannon Shen](https://www.szj.io/) and [Lucas Torroba Hennigen](https://ltorroba.github.io/). We also feature a guest lecture by [Prof. Andrew Head](https://www.andrewhead.info/) from UPenn.

Please join our [class Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/better-visual/shared_invite/zt-2a2bjoizb-hiTF6jP6i0WqS69jqc~AJQ) for the latest updates and engage in our discussions. And feel free to [e-mail us](mailto:zjshen@mit.edu,lucastor@mit.edu) directly if you have any questions or need any special accommodations!

### Schedule
The class will take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays from **1-2:30pm in 26-204**. The schedule is subject to change. Please check back regularly for updates.

All lectures will be recorded and shared online shortly after the class, alongside slides and lecture notes. We also offer a Zoom option for the class: please join via [this Zoom link](https://mit.zoom.us/j/98891264144).

We discuss why do we make visuals, what constitutes a good visual, and the process of making visuals. We study how to improve the design of visualization of the Anscombe's quartet, as well as inspect the design process of some figures in recent papers like [PaperMage](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.45.pdf). |

We attempted to draw analogies between figure making and coding ‚Äì what is the ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù, ‚Äúprogramming language‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIDE/tooling‚Äù in the context of making figures? It is followed by a live demo of making three figures, showcasing concrete techniques for using Figma to make the visuals. |

This talk will cover some of his latest research in this direction including [Math Augmentation](https://andrewhead.info/assets/pdf/augmented-formulas.pdf) and [FFL: A Language and Live Runtime for Styling and Labeling Typeset Math Formulas](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3586183.3606731). |

Specifically, it covers the principles of making slides for talk, as well as techniques for presenting complex results. Animations will be a key component in the design of the slides, and we will cover techniques for making proper animations. Optionally we can cover some techniques for recording talk videos (which is often required for accepted papers). |
